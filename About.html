    <h3>This APP was developed with the aim of fighting discrimination, prejudice and injustices against young people raised by LGBT families, and for helping those who are bullied because of their sexual orientation. This APP is suitable for the youngest ones which may be suffering from discrimination in an environment such as school, gym and or through the way to get there. Several studies on LGBT families and homosexuals have been concluded, none of these confirms that the welfare of these people is directly affected by being who they are. But, on the other hand, they encounter more difficulties during their life because they have to constantly face discriminations or injustices from our society due to their personal preferences. Therefore, the outcome of this APP is to signal and eradicate discrimination issues from the place where occur. The system will identify the place where the incident took place and if possible will connect the institution with specific authorities that will provide special resources to educate on how to avoid those problems in the future and to encourage living in a more respectful environment.
